# Morgoth's PKI - A Tale of Darkness and Trust

## Prelude

Arda is the world, the grand stage of fate, shaped by the Music of the Ainur—immortal spirits whose song wove the fabric of all creation. At the heart of it all stands Ilúvatar, the supreme and mysterious One, whose will and wisdom set the destiny of all things into motion.

In the deep, forgotten ages of Arda there arose Melkor, the mightiest of the Ainur—yet his heart was steeped in envy and malice. Forsaking the light of creation, he became Morgoth, the Black Foe of all that was good.

With a will as unyielding as the ancient mountains, he raised Angband, a fortress of dread and despair. Its towering, iron gates and labyrinthine depths echoed with the anguished cries of a shattered world, a dark mirror to his corrupted purpose.

In the wake of his ruin, from the very shadow of his legacy emerged Sauron, his cunning lieutenant. With whispered treachery and beguiling sorcery, he ensnared the lords of Elves, Men, and Dwarves alike, binding their noble hearts to his dark ambition and ensuring that the seed of Morgoth’s malice would forever taint the free peoples of Middle-earth.

## Your mission

Angband is in constant battle with the forces of light, and is in dire need of your expertise in the dark arts of PKI.

You shall invoke the power of Morgoth to forge your world. You must build your own model of understanding of PKI and implement the hardening that angband needs to withstand the onslaught of the Ainur.
